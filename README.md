# Git Basics: Practice

## Required Reading

### Using Git Branches

We'll focus on visualizing Git commands, especially branching, by working on [Atlassian Git Tutorials - Using Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
this is a great reference to keep handy moving forward.

## Required Tutorial

### Learn Git Branching

Here is a link to a [Git branching visualization tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), you are to complete
excercises 1, 2, and 3 of the Introduction Sequence.

1: Introduction to Git Commits
2: Branching in Git
3: Merging in Git

Do not continue on to exercise 4 which is about rebasing, more on that later in
the course.

If you have any questions during this tutorial, then review your class notes
and our talk repositories. To find them you can navigate to the [General Assembly WDI Boston](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston)
organization on GitHub and use the search box to find our Git repositories.

The image above is just to show how you can use the search feature on GitHub to
find repositories within an organization, this is useful if you want to go back
to look at a previous lesson but you can't remember the exact name of it.

## Optional Bonus

If you need more review, you may want to practice targeted review with [Learn Version Control with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/),
one of the best intermediate references available for free online. If you're
not satisfied with how well you understand a topic, then scan the table of
contents and give yourself a set amount of time to review it. After time is up,
move on! This practice is called [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)
and it is a great way to avoid getting off track.

Finally, review some of the great visuals provided at [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html).
These diagrams are more detailed and offer annotations that may help you
understand how Git works. They also make a great reference for later,
especially if you don't want to replay [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)
again.

## Required Response

Once you have completed the required reading and the required tutorial,
checkout to a new branch, `response`, and answer the questions in `study.md`.
Don't hesitate to add anything else that you want to let us know about your
experience with this practice or the course so far. After you've answered the
questions, create a pull request with your response.
