# Git Basics: Practice

## Required Reading

Read the [Comparing Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)
tutorial from Atlassian, until you get to the "Gitflow Workflow" section, which
is optional.

It's a solid overview of all of the commands that we've learned and an
introduction to common patterns that developers use to save their work with Git.
Pay particular attention to the "Feature Branch Workflow" section. It's okay if
you don't understand the workflows themselves. For now, focus on how the
commands are being used and how the changes are visualized. This should take
about an hour.

## Required Tutorial

If you have any questions during these tutorials, then review your class notes
and our talk repositories. To do that, navigate to the [General Assembly WDI Boston](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston)
organization on GitHub and use the search box to find our Git repositories.

### CodeSchool's Try Git

First, let's review the basic Git commands using CodeSchool's excellent, free
[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) tutorial. This should
take somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes to complete.

## Optional Tutorial

### Learn Git Branching

We'll focus on visualizing Git commands, especially branching, by working on [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)
this is a great reference if you get stuck on the `Required Tutorial`.

## Optional Bonus

If you need more review, then continue by working through the free chapter of
CodeSchool's [Interactive Git Tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real).

You may also want to practice targeted review with [Learn Version Control with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/),
one of the best intermediate references available for free online. If you're
not satisfied with how well you understand a topic, then scan the table of
contents and give yourself a set amount of time to review it. After time is up,
move on! This practice is called [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)
and it is a great way to avoid getting off track.

Finally, review some of the great visuals provided at [A Visual Git Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html).
These diagrams are more detailed and offer annotations that may help you
understand how Git works. They also make a great reference for later,
especially if you don't want to replay [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)
again.

## Required Response

Once you have completed all of the required readings and the required tutorials,
checkout to a new branch, `response`, and answer the questions in `study.md`.
Don't hesitate to add anything else that you want to let us know about your
experience with this practice or the course so far. After you've answered the
questions, create a pull request with your response.
